## Index creation

Index creation (with cbq) could depend on having enough index nodes available to
satisfy the num_replica requirement of the index. If the member nodes have not
yet been taken into the cluster with a rebalance, index creation with
num_replica >= 1 will fail.

The cbq program will exit with error code 0, even if the -exit-on-error option
is used, and even if there's a single erroneous statement in the script file. So
another means of error handling is necessary.

Example:

```text
ubuntu@ip-10-250-162-116:~$ /opt/couchbase/bin/cbq -e couchbase://127.0.0.1/ -u testuser -p testpassword -f cbq_scripts/01-foo
 Connected to : <http://127.0.0.1:8091/>. Type Ctrl-D or \QUIT to exit.

 Path to history file for the shell : /home/ubuntu/.cbq_history
CREATE INDEX emails_sharded_idx ON `mybucket`(lower(`email`)) PARTITION BY hash(lower("email")) WHERE (type = "user") WITH { "defer_build": true, "num_replica": 1 };
{

    "results": [
    ],
    "errors": [
        {
            "code": 5000,
            "msg": "GSI CreateIndex() - cause: Fails to create index.  There are not enough indexer nodes to create index with replica count of 1. Some indexer nodes may be marked as excluded."
        }
    ],
    "status": "errors",
    "metrics": {
        "elapsedTime": "7.460796ms",
        "executionTime": "7.369777ms",
        "resultCount": 0,
        "resultSize": 0,
        "errorCount": 1
    }
}
 ERROR 174 : Unspecified error.
```

Note that the entire output is on stdout, including the "ERROR 174" part. This
makes handling errors pretty challenging.
